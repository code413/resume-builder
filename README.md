# Resume Builder

## Brief
Using **Laravel**, create a tool that allows users build web-based résumés.

In your app, a user should be able to:
- Create a resume under her name with a unique URL.
- Add her education records.
- Add her work experience records. 

For the purpose of this test, the builder is **not required** to support addition of any other types of details to the resume.

## Timeline
This project should not take any longer than **1 week** to complete.

## Evaluation Criteria
Once we receive your work, we'll evaluate it based on:
- The error-free functionality of your work. 
- The quality of your code. 

Appropriate use of frontend technologies and a clean presentation, although not required, will be evaluated as bonus points.
