# Resume Builder

## Brief
Using **Laravel**, create a tool that allows users build web-based résumés.

In your app, a user should be able to:
- Create a resume. The resume should have a unique public URL that users can share with others. 
- Add her education records.
- Add her work experience records.

For the purpose of this test, the builder is **not required** to support addition of any other types of details to the resume.

## Timeline
This project should be completed in **1 week**.

## Evaluation Criteria
Once we receive your work, we'll evaluate it based on:
- The usability of the final product
- The error-free functionality of your work
- The quality of your code

Appropriate use of frontend technologies will be evaluated as a bonus point.
